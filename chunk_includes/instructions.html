<p>In this experiment, you will see a number of pictures with
  characters paired with a set of objects displayed on the
  screen. You will hear a descriptions of the objects that one of the
  characters has, and your job is to select the one that best matches
  the description.</p>
 <p> Note that some of the objects are hidden by a
  black box, so that you can only guess what they are.
  But if none of the pictures with visible objects match the
  description, you can safely choose the one with the hidden objects,
  if it seems like it can fit the description provided.</p>
