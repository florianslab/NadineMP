<p>With this experiment, we're investigating various issues in how people understand and interpret the indefinite determiner ‘a’ and definite determiner ‘the’ in contexts in which the different inferences  
they evoke hold or do not hold. The numeral ‘one’ provides a fur-ther point of comparison. 
The sentences you heard thus included a variant of one of the following: </p>

<p>(1)	{A/The/One} book on Peter’s shelf is blue.</p>

<p>Statements with the definite determiner ‘the’ are typically understood as suggesting that there is exactly one item of the relevant kind in the context, i.e. for the sentence in (1) the assumption would be
that there is exactly one book on Peter’s shelf. The indefinite is as-sumed to evoke the opposite inference that there is more than one book on Peter’s shelf. In addition, the sentence with the  
indefinite (as well as with ‘one’) seems to imply that there is exactly one blue book on Peter’s shelf. </p> 

<p>Our research aims to investigate the status of these inference using the visual world eye-tracking method. We present sentences with the definite and indefinite using auditory material. While hearing the 
sentences people are presented with different competing pic-tures that do or do not match the different inferences evoked by the determiner in ques-tion. They are asked to pick the picture that best 
matches what the sentence describes. While they make their choice their eye-movements are measured. </p>

<p>The results will help us understand both the status of these inferences by looking how often interpretation and picture choice is influenced by the inferences evoked, and the time course of the derivation of these different inferences by looking at their eye move-ments as the sentence unfolds. </p>

<p>On a more general level, this study will inform current debates on the processing of dif-ferent types of meaning in natural language and help us to design further experiments us-ing fine-grained timing measures 
to understand the relative time course of these interpre-tations unfolding in online language processing. </p>
